# Project Set Up - Docker

The project was built on docker. Since the structure has been divided into several parts, several servers are running. 
According you need to have Docker and docker-compose on your local machine.

#### Step 1

Install Docker and docker-compose

|                  | Version                   |  
| :--------------- | :------------------------ |  
| `Docker`         | `Docker version 20.10.21` |  
| :--------------- | :------------------------ |  
| `docker-compose` | `version 1.29.2`          | 


#### Step 2

Go to the `docker` directory in the project structure using terminal and run `docker-compose up`

    - This will download all docker container resources and Up all containers 
    - There ara four containers: `simtech-app`, `simtech-nginx`, `simtech-db`, `simtech-mailhog`
    - The app will be running on the port: `http://localhost:8000/`
    - MailHog: http://localhost:8025/

#### Step 3

Connect to Mysql database wich is running in docker container  (it's easier to configure in Mysql Workbench)

    - Hostname: 127.0.0.1
    - Port: 3307
    - Password: root

Create database Schema, use datadump to insert the table with sample data into your database.

Insert your database name in .env file (DB_DATABASE)

# Using the project

The project consists of three main pages, a landing page, a form submission page and a page with all the results. (also success page and 404 page)

In the project configured an email-testing tool MailHog. It gives possibility to test that outgoing emails from your app or website actually end up in the recipientâ€™s mailbox. After each form submission you can open the the url http://localhost:8025/ and test your sended form data.
